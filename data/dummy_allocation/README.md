## Dummy allocation

This folder contains data for a dummy allocation of a 100'000 population to 380 buildings over a 10-year period. 
The building allocation is donve via the `Building.ID` key.

A simple random allocation is done while trying to respect the number of people already allocated to each building. 
The allocation is done for each year, therefore there is significant change in the year to year allocation.
In essence, all residents relocate each year.
