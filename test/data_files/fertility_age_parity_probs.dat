# birth parity probabilities
# lines beginning with '@' force the beginning of a new subtable
# the seven subtables are queried using `floor((mother_age-15)/5)`:
# ages 0-19 gives index 0 (sub-table 1)
# ages 20-24 gives index 1 (sub-table 2)
# ages 25-29 gives index 2 (sub-table 3)
# ages 30-34 gives index 3 (sub-table 4)
# ages 35-39 gives index 4 (sub-table 5)
# ages 40-44 gives index 5 (sub-table 6)
# ages 45-50 gives index 6 (sub-table 7)
# the subtable gives the probability of a mother in an age-range of having 0-5 (row values) of children at a particular
# point in time. Note that x=0 actually increases for the 45-50, compared to other groups. Parity should increase over
# age, as it captures the total number of children, unless child-mortality kicks in after a while.
# To assign children to mothers, one would sample an mother's age, then the number of children for that
# mother based on the parity table. All females at the age with one less child are then candidates.
# Or, if a mother's age is first drawn based on fertility age probabilities, then this should be the probability that
# a mother will have a child given that she has already had `x` children.
